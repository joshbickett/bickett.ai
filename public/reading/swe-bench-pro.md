- Capture the expanded scope versus SWE-Bench Classic, especially multi-file and multi-step fixes.
- Note evaluation setup details that affect Bickett.ai agent benchmarking (environment constraints, repo coverage, patch metrics).
- Pull out any baseline results we can compare against Gemini CLI agent performance.

> Flag follow-up work: reproduce at least one SWE-Bench Pro sample locally to understand workflow friction.
