- Summarized RE-Bench design: long-horizon repair-and-extend tasks that bundle repo snapshots, environment setup, and evaluation oracles for realistic agent runs.
- Captured notes on metrics (task success, edit cost, regression checks) that align with Bickett.ai's agent telemetry.
- Logged follow-up ideas for porting the benchmark harness into our Gemini CLI workflows.

> Finished reading. Next follow-up: draft plan to adapt Bickett.ai's agent harness so it can replay the RE-Bench scenarios end-to-end.
