# Share thread on coding from your phone
- [ ] Draft thread outline covering the Blink + tmux workflow.
- [ ] Pull in screenshots / short clips showing setup on iPhone.
- [ ] Highlight alternative cloud VM options for persistent SSH (Oracle, Fly.io, GCP credits).
- [ ] Call out Codespaces limitation and point to workaround resources.
- [ ] Schedule and post the thread; cross-post to Mastodon and Threads.

> GitHub doesn’t currently expose a raw SSH hostname/port you can use directly from Blink. They force SSH traffic to flow through `gh`, which Blink can’t do, so Codespaces can’t support this setup today.
