- Define the central thesis for "Y accelerate"â€”why Y Combinator's pace still matters in 2025
- Pull supporting anecdotes from recent batch updates, internal tooling shifts, and alumni stories
- Outline sections covering velocity habits, capital efficiency, and founder rituals
- Draft the full post in `public/blog/y-accelerate.md`, aiming for a five-minute read with strong pull-quotes
- Workshop the intro and closing call-to-action with two trusted reviewers before publishing
