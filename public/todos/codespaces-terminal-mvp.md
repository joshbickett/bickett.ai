# MVP: Codespaces Terminal (Mobile)
- [ ] GitHub OAuth (Device Flow) -> token
- [ ] REST: list/start/stop my codespaces
- [ ] SSH client -> open terminal to codespace
- [ ] If suspended: start -> reconnect
- [ ] (Opt) Ensure devcontainer has `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1`
- [ ] Note: idle timeout 5-240 min; handle resume
- [ ] Publish simple README describing phone/computer Codespaces workflow to track stars

> Build a smooth cross-device flow so I can ship from anywhere and see how the community responds.
